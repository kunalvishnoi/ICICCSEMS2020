							<h3>Advancements in AI/ML and Robotics  in Digital Transformation</h3>
							<p>

Fast technological advances in digitization and data and analytics have been reshaping the business scene, supercharging performance, and empowering the development of new business advancements and new types of competition. In the meantime, the innovation itself keeps on developing, getting new waves of advances in robotics technology, analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI), and particularly ML. Together they
add up to a stage change in technical abilities that could have significant ramifications for business, for the economy, and all the more extensively, for society.

Individuals used to state that data is power however that is not true anymore. The challenges that industries face today is to analyse this data to make meaningful information out of this and take informed decisions. Hence the analysis of the data, utilization of the information, diving into it, that is the power. From a business point of view, data analytics can be utilized to build income, respond to developing patterns, improve operational proficiency and streamline marketing to make an upper hand. Notwithstanding, with such huge numbers of trendy expressions flying about, for example, data lakes, machine learning and artificial intelligence, it tends to be hard to comprehend where the value is coming from and what an external supplier can offer.

Today, with each industry experiencing a digital transformation, through intelligent insights. Later on, the industry will progressively adjust Augmented Data Management and Analytics, Continuous Intelligence, NLP and Conversational Analytics, Commercial AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning contributions. It will empower change around the subjects – Operational advancement, Revenue Enhancement, Dynamic Personalization, and new plans of action. Companies will begin utilizing open source toolset and make solutions that focus on Reinforced Learning support; steady adjusting of ML models, Geospatial Analytics, AI-controlled activities management platforms and Cloud-Based Intelligence Delivery.

Recent advances in robotics, AI, and ML are pushing the boundaries of what machines can do in all spheres of business and the economy. Physical robots have been around for quite a while in manufacturing, however, progressively proficient, progressively adaptable, more secure, and more affordable robots are currently captivating in consistently increasing activities and integrating both mechanization, cognitive and learning abilities, improving after some time as they are prepared by their human collaborators on the shop floor, or increasingly learn without the help of anyone.

Speaker will discuss the challenges in implementing this in Indian Context considering the state of preparedness of the Industry with a focus on India.

						<h3>Artificial Intelligence Innovations for Better Medical and Healthcare Solutions: Supporting the medical professionals and improving the patients outcomes.</h3>
						<p>The predominant application of positron emission tomography (PET) in the field of oncology and radiotherapy and the significance of medical imaging research have led to an urgent need for effective approaches to PET volume analysis and the development of accurate and robust volume analysis techniques to support oncologists in their clinical practice, including diagnosis, arrangement of appropriate radiotherapy treatment, and evaluation of patients' response to therapy. This research proposes an efficient optimized classifier to tackle the problem of analysis of squamous cell carcinoma in patient PET volumes. This optimized classifier is based on different novel artificial intelligence-based approaches. Experimental National Electrical Manufacturers Association and International Electrotechnical Commission (NEMA IEC) body phantom data sets and clinical PET studies of participants with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma are used in this research. Superior results were achieved using the new optimized classifier when compared with the results from any other investigated classifiers. This has significantly supported the clinicians as well as the patients.
